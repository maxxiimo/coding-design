### The Role of Front End Engineers, A Paradigm Shift

Over the last several years I've noticed a paradigm shift in the role that front-end engineers play in the website design process. Back in the day, great website design was difficult without a graphic designer; and decision-makers tended to gravitate towards brainstorming on usability and information architecture at the graphic design phase of the development process – which began and oftentimes ended before front-end engineers were really involved. Today this is no longer the case. The role of front-end engineers has changed. If you are a front-end engineer, or a project manager still doing it the old way, read on. It might not be the best way. Let me explain.

#### That Was Then

Before CSS3, without advanced Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator knowledge graphic designers were the ones who produced design elements like rounded corners, nonstandard OS fonts for headers, background gradients, good-looking buttons, icons, and so forth. It couldn't be done with code, and the visual medium to deliver these elements to project stakeholders was the design mockup:

Non-coding stakeholders – customers, project managers, executives  – liked mockups because they could actually see and understand what the final product might look like. Changes could be made quickly. Consequently, discussion centered around mockups; before any front-end engineering costs were incurred. Doing so was almost always more efficient and cost-effective.

For these reasons front-end developers found the bulk of their contribution to projects on the implementation side of things, i.e. turning completed mockups into code. We understood what kind of code the back-end team needed and had the skills necessary to turn graphic design into pixel perfect – the standard of excellence back then – cross browser friendly code.

#### This Is Now

Fast-forward to today and the predominantly implementation-only role of front-end engineers has changed. The catalyst: CSS3, JavaScript frameworks, and mobile.

CSS3 made it possible to produce design elements directly in the browser as code rather than image mockups. Need a corner radius on an element? No problem, there is a property for that. Need to respond to different screen sizes? Done. Need a color gradient? Easy. (And the list goes on.) Advances in CSS have made it increasingly more efficient to produce dynamic and responsive prototypes with CSS3 rather than static mockups.

Add JavaScript and what is happening on the front end cannot be easily demonstrated in a static mockup. Take for example jQuery and its plethora of community developed plug-ins. how do you show the interactivity of some of these plug-ins with a mockup?  I'm not saying it can't be done, but what's the better way?

CSS and JavaScript, however, are only the tip of the iceberg. Mobile is the game changer. Before mobile the one-size-fits-all static mockup paradigm could work, but today, forgetaboutit.

There's just too much variation, and the variation  is beginning to go well beyond the typical screen sizes shown above. Browser prototyping by nature is more representative of how a webpage will ultimately look and behave across different devices. Users can instantly access and interact with a prototype on any device anywhere, but not with a mockup, and understanding the capabilities and/or limitations of browsers and devices in a constantly evolving landscape is a necessity; an area of expertise more often than not found with front-end engineers.

#### The Action is in the Browser

Yesterday the action centered around the design mockup, but today, usability, information architecture, and design decisions are beginning to convalesce around the point where front-end code is written, namely, browser prototyping. Of course design mockups are incredibly useful in informing prototypes, but bringing front-end engineers to the center of the design and development process from the get go will translate into a more rapid, iterative, interactive, and agile design process.

#### Changing Roles

The takeaway for front-end engineers... your role is changing. Think of yourself as a coder and an artist. Your canvas, the viewport. You are the handshake between design and logic and can work in either realm. With this changing role, in addition to coding prowess, understanding the elements of good design, the "art," is essential to your success and the success of projects you participate in.

One final thought: never undervalue the hard earned design talents of graphic designers. Beautiful design is not easy.
