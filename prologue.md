### Paradigm Shift

Over the last several years I've noticed a paradigm shift in the role that front end engineers play in the design process. Back in the day for really great design you absolutely needed a Graphic Designer. Unless you could work Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator like there was no tomorrow, Graphic Designers were the ones who produced rounded corners, cool fonts, gradients, translucent images, buttons, icons, icon sprites, etc.. In addition to required design elements, Graphic Designers created visual mockups of a website that non-coding stakeholders could "touch and feel", i.e. actually see and understand.

Discussion and changes could then be made around these mockups before any engineering costs were incurred; it was more efficient and cost-effective to do it this way. As a result decision-makers would gravitate towards brainstorming on usability, architecting, and the design aspects of a project at the graphic design phase in the development process: that began and oftentimes ended before front end engineers were really involved.

Back then that kind of made sense, it was a simpler world, one design could almost fit all, and things happening in the browser were not as super interactive as they are today. Consequently, front end developers found the bulk of their contribution to a project in implementing completed mockups: They understood what kind of code the backend team needed and how they would use it, and they had the skills necessary to turn graphic design into pixel perfect – the standard of excellence back then – cross browser friendly code.

Fast-forward to today and everything has changed:

- HTML5 and CSS3 have made it possible – preferable – to produce design elements directly in the browser as code rather than images.
- It is increasingly more efficient to produce dynamic and responsive prototypes with the benefits of CSS3, rather than static mockups.
- Much of what is happening on the front end cannot be easily replicated in a static mockup.
- Prototyping by nature is more representative of how a webpage will ultimately look and behave across different devices.
- Users can instantly access and interact with a prototype, not with a mockup.
- One size no longer fits all. Technologies and devices are rapidly changing.
- Understanding the resulting capabilities and/or limitations of browsers and devices in a constantly evolving landscape is not a luxury but a necessity, and an area of expertise more often than not found with front end engineers.

As a result of these changes; usability, architecting and design decisions are beginning to convalesce around the point in which front end code is written, prototyping, as opposed to around graphic design mockups. Design elements feed into prototyping, and are necessary, but today, the absence of front end developers in the design process is no longer an option.

The end result of the paradigm shift for the design and development process is a more rapid, iterative, interactive, and [agile design process][].

The takeaway in relation to this chapter is that as front end engineers you need to understand that your role is changing. With the abilities of CSS3, think of yourself as a coder and an artist. You are the handshake between design and backend engineering and can work in either realm. With this new role, in addition to coding prowess, understanding the elements of good design, the art, is essential to the success of projects you will participate in.

This and the next three chapters are written to help developers along this path, but before exploring this art let me leave you with one final thought: never undervalue the hard earned design talents of graphic designers. Beautiful design is not easy.
