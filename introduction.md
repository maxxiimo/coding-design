Introduction
============

Thank you for downloading and taking the time to read Coding Design. A lot of thought and research has been put into writing Coding Design, and it is written with the developer in mind. It is also a continuation of [The Front End Manifesto][Manifesto], but you do not have to read the first book to follow along.

The goal of Coding Design is to help front-end developers to become better designers using the tools that come natural to them: HTML5, CSS3, and a browser.
