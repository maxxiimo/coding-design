Appendix 4
----------

Here you will find recommendations for:

1.  Font stacks that you can copy and use in your project.

2.  Web safe fonts, i.e. fonts that are most common on most versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux.

    You can copy these and feel confident using them as your overall default font stack, or as a fallback font stack for a more interesting typeface.

3.  Typefaces that go well together, say one font for your headers and another contrasting font for your body.

4.  Mobile fonts.

5.  Font classifications and definitions.

### Font Stack Roundup

1.  *06/26/08* - [Better CSS Font Stacks][Better Stacks]

3.  *01/08/09* - [8 Definitive Web Font Stacks Article][Definitive]

    > The font stacks listed here are grouped together by the universal font that forms the base of that stack. A designer can therefore decide on a typographical look for their site, grab the appropriate font stack, and tweak it to suit their needs.

4.  *09/22/09* - [Guide to CSS Font Stacks: Techniques and Resources][Techniques]

    > CSS Font stacks are one of those things that elude a lot of designers. Many stick to the basic stacks Dreamweaver auto-recommends or go even more basic by just specifying a single web-safe font.

5.  *03/19/12* - [Complete Guide to Pre-Installed Fonts in Linux, Mac, and Windows][Complete Guide]

    > Web fonts are gaining in popularity now, but they can still be a bit of a challenge to use. Copyright issues often require the use of a third-party font service, which can be risky and expensive.The good news is that all major operating systems come with a variety of fonts that you can use to create your font stacks.

8.  [TYPECHART][]

    > Browse web type, grab CSS. TYPECHART lets you flip through, preview and compare web typography while retrieving the CSS.

9.  [Revised Font Stack][]

    > Serious efforts are being made to get more typeface choices on the web to enhance web typography. Still, most of us prefer web-safe fonts like: Verdana, Georgia, Times New Roman and Arial. Though choices are limited, yet the number can be increased by exploring other pre-installed fonts.

#### Web Safe

2.  *03/10* - [Four Techniques for Combining Fonts][Four Techniques]

7.  [Pairing Fonts is Like Feeding Children..][Pairing Fonts]

3.  [Font Factory][]

    > Fonts fall into logical categories, e.g. Serif or Script etc. But within a category, there are many subtitles, so we have assigned each font a specific sub-category that best describes the unique elements of a font. Each of the primary categories below have further categories to explore.

### Choosing Typefaces

The following is designed to help you choose your typefaces. Here are some articles, and an excellent transcript from a presentation by Jason Santa Maria.

#### Choosing Typeface Articles

1.  *12/14/10* - [“What Font Should I Use?”: Five Principles for Choosing and Using Typefaces][Five Principles]

2.  *08/25/11* - [A Brief Primer on Typeface Selection][Brief Primer]

3.  *12/01/11* - [6 Questions You Should Ask Yourself When Choosing Fonts][6 Questions]

4.  *09/26/12* - [Make a Statement with Type][Type Statement]

Mobile

5.  *10/02/11* - [5 Tips for Excellent Mobile Typography][5 Tips]

6.  *11/12/12* - [Mobile Design Typography is Vitally Important ... and Challenging][Mobile typography]

#### Jason Santa Maria On Web Typography

Jason Santa Maria, in a presentation at [Build 2011][] called [On Web Typography][] spoke about picking typefaces. I've transcribed it here in part and slightly paraphrased:

1.  Questions to ask yourself: What are you using it for? How will it be used? Under what conditions? From the slide "considerations":

    > **Dimensions**
    > Are there requirements for how much text must fit in a given region?

    > **Special Features** - Do you require special features your typefaces
    > What features do you require? Multiple weights, lining &amp; old-style figures, small caps, etc?

    > **Prolonged Reading** -
    > Is this a book or a long format periodical?

    > **Internationalization** -
    > Does a given font support all the special characters of the language to be used?


2.  Readability and distinctness in characters matters. Will the typeface cause the reader to become confused, or tired of reading it?

3.  Avoid readymades. Fonts with design baked in.

4.  Develop your own personal palette. Find typefaces that you like, that you gravitate to, and keep using them. Get to know a typeface.

5.  Get to know the history of a typeface. When was it designed? Why was it designed? This should complement not contradict your text/subject.

6.  Find typefaces that embody a mental association: terms you want to associate with the design.

7.  Pair fonts that are designed together, they will work well together. The serif for the body text, the sans serif for the supplementary stuff like page numbers and captions.

8.  Use alternatives for commonly used typefaces get the same type of feel without being the same as everyone else. For example Helvetica. You can use an alternative rather than the frequently used Helvetica itself: FF Dagny, Proxima Nova, Museo Sans, Prehematica Slabserif.

9.  Try it out! Test out your ideas. See how it looks. See how it reads. See how it feels. In long-form text, in short-form text. Small columns, wide columns. Big text, small text. Doing this gives you a very real impression on how other people are going to see it.
